## CI/CD Concept Definitions
![](images/cdicd.png)
- Continuous Integration: Delivery of development and tested code 
- Continuous Delivery: Testing in a production-like environment such as staging, QA or live-sh; delivering something that the DevOps team could take and do something with it in the productions stage but not actually putting it into production
- Continuous Deployment: Development, test, staging and going into production is all automated

### Continuous Deployment vs Delivery
- Delivery has a few manual steps prior to going live in production
- Deployment, the whole pipeline is automated
